<h1>Splunk: Home SOC Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Set up a SOC lab by installing and configuring Splunk on both Linux and Windows hosts, deploying Splunk Forwarders, and ingesting OS-based and web logs for centralized analysis. Gained hands-on experience with SIEM deployment, log collection, and cross-platform monitoringâ€”key skills for SOC operations. TryHackMe site was used and I had to provide answers to questions.

- Command: Splunk restart (This command stops all the running Splunk processes and then starts them again. This is useful when changes have been made to the Splunk configuration files or when the server needs to be restarted for any other reason.)
